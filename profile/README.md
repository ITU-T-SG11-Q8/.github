# Introduction

This group is for prototyping protocols that are specified in ITU-T Q.8/11 as open source projects. We hope that this repository will serve as a tool to spread collaboration, improve standards, ensure interoperability, and more. We believe the cooperative open-source development activities will be helpful for identifying and patching problems during development (or even after the development) of Recommendations, and thus we can increase completeness and stability of Recommendations, as well as get hints for developing new Recommendations and its application services.


# ITU-T

## SG11
ITU-T Study Group 11 is responsible for developing international standards that define how ICT services are handled in the network, and also leads ITUâ€™s work on conformance and interoperability (C&I) testing. 

## Question 8/11
Q8/11 has been working on specifying protocols to realize distributed overlay networking such as managed P2P and hybrid P2P networking. 



## Relavant ITU-T Recommendations
- ITU-T Q.4102, "Hybrid Peer-to-Peer Communication: Peer protocol"
- ITU-T Q.4103, "Hybrid Peer-to-Peer Communication: Overlay management protocol"
